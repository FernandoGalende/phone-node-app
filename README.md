# React-Redux PHONE app backend

This projec is the backend side of phone react app developed by Fernando Aparcio Galende.
This project was created with Node and Express.
I use bulma to styles and customs styles was added to make the app responsive below 600px width.
For unit testing I install jest & enzyme to ensure quality of the project.

## Getting Started


You can serve the backend application locally in debug mode using `docker-compose up`, for this you need to have installed desktop docker app, you can download in the docker offical page.

If you have problems with `docker-compose up` after install desktop should run `docker run --detach --publish=80:80 --name=webserver nginx` and then `docker-compose up`.

You can run the docker without `docker-compose up` using directly Dockerfile. you should run first `docker build -t phone_app_backend .` and then
`docker run -p 3000:3000 -it phone_app_backend`

If you prefer you can not use docker.
You need to run npm i located in the root directory to install dependencies and then you can serve the application locally in debug mode by running `npm run start`.

Runs the app in the development mode in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

You will also see any lint errors in the console.
